Shoshin: AI-Powered Smart Flashcards for Deeper Learning

🚀 Revolutionizing problem-solving study methods with AI-driven flashcards.

📌 Overview

Anki is a popular study tool that leverages active recall and spaced repetition to help users memorize information efficiently. While it excels at subjects like psychology and history, which require rote memorization, it falls short for math, physics, and chemistry, where problem-solving is key.

Enter Shoshin.

Shoshin transforms lecture notes and class materials into AI-generated problem-based flashcards. It records the techniques used to solve problems and automatically solves for the answer. Unlike traditional flashcards, every study session is unique—Shoshin dynamically modifies numbers and adds extra steps to problems while solving for the new answer.

📖 “Shoshin” (初心) is a Japanese term meaning beginner’s mind—an open, eager, and unbiased approach to learning, even at an advanced level.

✨ Features

✅ AI-Powered Problem Variation – Changes numbers or adds new steps to existing flashcards.
✅ Anki-Like Spaced Repetition – Ensures optimal long-term retention.
✅ Study Decks & Sessions – Save and review decks with a smart learning algorithm.
✅ User Accounts & Deck Storage – Create an account and store decks securely.

🚀 Backlog (Planned Features)

🔄 AI-Generated Flashcards from Lecture Notes – Automatically extract problems from study materials.
